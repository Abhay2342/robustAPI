## Features

- **User Authentication**: RobustAPI ensures secure user authentication using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT tokens for session management. Users can sign up, log in, and access protected endpoints with ease.
- **Course Management**: The application allows users to browse, enroll in, and view courses. It implements robust validation to prevent duplicate enrollments and ensures a seamless user experience.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: RobustAPI implements robust error handling mechanisms, providing meaningful error messages to clients. It also utilizes logging to track API requests, responses, and potential errors or exceptions for debugging purposes.
- **Filters and Pagination**: Users can refine their course search using filtering options based on criteria such as category and level. Pagination is implemented to enhance performance when dealing with large datasets.
- **User Enrollment APIs**: RobustAPI offers APIs for course enrollment, allowing users to enroll in courses they are interested in. It also provides an endpoint for users to view the courses they have enrolled in.
